This project is a showcase of my React development skills, with a focus on efficiently managing and rendering state. The entire application is built with React, utilizing a state-driven architecture to handle dynamic updates and user interactions seamlessly.

Key Features:
Real-time Updates with State Management
The resume preview updates in real-time as you input data, all powered by React's state management. The left section allows for data input, and the right side renders the resume instantly, demonstrating the efficient use of multiple states.

Collapsible Sections
I have implemented collapsible sections to keep the UI clean and organized. The entire structure is managed through React states to ensure that only the necessary parts of the application render when needed.

Custom Scrolling and Syncing
When editing different sections, the preview on the right automatically scrolls to the relevant section. This feature demonstrates how React state can be leveraged to sync user inputs with visual components across the page.

Optimized Rendering
With use of React.memo and other techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders, the app remains efficient, even with complex state management. This ensures smooth performance, which is a key consideration in React development.

This project serves as a practical example of my understanding of React, particularly in handling dynamic UIs, managing component states, and optimizing rendering behavior.
